This Rust program computes Euler's Totient function, Ï†(n), which counts the number of positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to it. 
To determine coprimality, the program employs a helper function to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd).

The program contains
1. GCD Calculation: Uses the Euclidean technique to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
2. Euler's Totient Function: Returns the number of numbers up to n that are coprime to n.
